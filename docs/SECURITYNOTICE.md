# Security Notice ‚Äì Antivirus False-Positive Flags on GestureSesh Executable  
**Date:** 2025-07-06

## Description
Some antivirus engines (e.g., Microsoft Defender, Avast, AVG) may flag the Windows `.exe` build of **GestureSesh** as malware or *‚ÄúTrojan:Win32/Wacatac.C!ml‚Äù*, even though the application is safe.  
The alerts are **false positives** caused by the PyInstaller bootloader. PyInstaller is occasionally abused by threat actors, so several AV vendors treat any binary that contains its generic bootloader as suspicious [[1]](#1-pyinstaller-maintainers-on-recurring-av-false-positives-github-issue-6754) [[2]](#2-discussion-of-pyinstaller-false-positives-on-stack-overflow).

## Affected Versions
| Platform | Package Type | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Windows  | `GestureSesh-*.exe` built with PyInstaller (< v0.5.0 and ‚â• v0.5.0) | **Affected** ‚Äì may trigger AV flags |
| macOS / Linux | `.app`, `.dmg`, or ELF binaries | Not affected |

## Mitigation / Work-arounds
1. **Verify the official checksum** (see the release assets for SHA-256 hashes).  
2. **Whitelist / allow-list** the executable in your antivirus product.  
3. **Submit the file as ‚Äúfalse positive‚Äù** to your AV vendor‚Äôs portal (links below). After enough reports, vendors typically update their signatures.  
4. Always download releases only from the this repo's Releases page or from [https://gesturesesh.com/](https://gesturesesh.com)
