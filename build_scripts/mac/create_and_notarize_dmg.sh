# create_and_notarize_dmg.sh
#
# Creates, signs, notarizes, staples, and verifies a DMG from a pre-built and
# signed .app bundle.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Set the required environment variables:
#    export CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Your Developer ID Application Certificate Name"
#    export APPLE_ID="your-apple-id@example.com"
#    export TEAM_ID="YourTeamID"
#    export NOTARY_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password"
#
# 2. Run the script from your terminal:
#    ./path/to/create_and_notarize_dmg.sh
